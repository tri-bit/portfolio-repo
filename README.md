# Design examples
While my goals are primarily developer oriented I do have experience creating website designs **without themes.** (Primarily in Webflow.) While I do create custom elements in photoshop, etc when needed I am not a traditional logo/graphic designer.

## Starbrite Cleaners

This is a old (2015) site but I'm proud of the dynamic layout. (Wordpress platform, site theme basically ignored,  with alot of jQuery to create the dynamic layout/animation.) Starbrite logo by Stephen Fleming.
